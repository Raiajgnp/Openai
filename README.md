# OpenAI Codex Chatbot

ü§ñ An OpenAI-powered chatbot designed to provide intelligent and human-like interactions using OpenAI Codex. This project serves as an implementation and exploration of the capabilities of OpenAI's Codex API for various use cases, including conversational AI and task automation.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Enables smooth and intuitive conversations.
- **Customizable Functionality**: Built to accommodate various use cases, including task assistance and interactive Q&A.
- **OpenAI Codex Integration**: Utilizes the Codex API to interpret and execute natural language instructions.

## üöß Current Status
‚ö†Ô∏è **This chatbot is currently non-functional** due to the lack of a valid OpenAI API key.

### Why?
The OpenAI Codex API requires a **paid subscription** to function. Unfortunately, this project does not include an active subscription, and therefore, the chatbot cannot make API calls to OpenAI servers.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
API Key Reuired: Without a paid OpenAI API key, the chatbot will not work.
Cost: OpenAI's API usage incurs costs based on the number of tokens processed.

## üì¢ Disclaimer
This project is a demonstration of OpenAI Codex's capabilities. It is not affiliated with OpenAI and does not include a functional API key by default. The user is responsible for obtaining and managing their API key to enable functionality.
